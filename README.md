# gorilla

gorilla is the ultimate wordlist tool packing a lot of amazing utilities like:
- building wordlists based on patterns (like [crunch](https://github.com/jim3ma/crunch))
- building wordlists based on common password/username formats (like [cupp](https://github.com/Mebus/cupp))
- scrap a web page and build a wordlist from its words (like [cewl](https://github.com/digininja/CeWL))
- extending existing wordlists using mutations (like [hashcat's rule based attack](https://hashcat.net/wiki/doku.php?id=rule_based_attack))


## installing with cargo

With Rust's [Cargo](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) installed, run `cargo install --git https://github.com/d4rckh/gorilla --branch main`

You should now be able to run `gorilla --help`

## building with cargo

```
cargo build --release
# the binary will be located in target/release folder
```

## computing passwords

The `--from-pattern`/`-p` argument is used to tell gorilla to compute passwords based on a pattern. 
For example, the following command will print every single word containing 5 lowercase letters.

```
gorilla --from-pattern "{a-z}{a-z}{a-z}{a-z}{a-z}"
```

Other examples of patterns are `administrator{0-9}` (`administrator0` -> `administrator9`); `hello_world{a-z}{0-9}` (`hello_worlda0` -> `hello_worldz9`).

If you want to save the output to a file, you can use the `--output-file`/`-o` argument.

Gorilla now also supports character sets. They are defined in `src/char_sets.rs`. Here are some examples of patterns that use them: `{l}` => a b c d ... z; `{u}` => A B C D ... Z; `{d}` => 1 2 3 4 ... 9; `{s}` => (space) ! " # $ ... ~ 

## modifying existing wordlists using mutations/rules

Using the command line arguments you can do any mutation that is supported but you are only limited to only 1 set of mutations. A mutation set is a set of mutations applied to a word. Via the cli, mutations are supplied via the `--mutation`/`-m` argument.

```
gorilla --from-pattern "administrator" --mutation "prepend:_"
```

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/35298550/183973759-63dcc1c7-c32b-49b4-be68-838d99535f5a.png)

Usually you will want to use the `--from-file`/`-i` argument instead of `--from-pattern` in this case to specify a wordlist instead of a single word, but to keep things simple, I will use that. 

The above command takes in 1 word and outputs 1 word: `_administrator`. You can add multiple mutations using the same parameter.

```
gorilla --from-pattern "administrator" \
  -m "prepend:_" \
  -m "append:{0-9}"
```

This once again takes 1 single word, but will output 10 different ones. Adding the `{0-9}` syntax to prepend & append will result in multiple words getting generated. The above command generates the following words.

```
_administrator0
_administrator1
_administrator2
[.. snip ..]
_administrator8
_administrator9
```

If we were to supply a wordlist via the `-i` file, we'd get back the amount of words we had in that wordlist times 10.

So far we only applied 1 single set of mutations. Usually you will want to combine multiple of these. This is done via the yaml files. You specify one using the `--mutations-file`/`-f` argument. An example one is located in `sets/simple.yml` file in this repo and it looks like this:

```yaml
name: simple

mutation_sets:
  - [ nothing ] # => word
  - [ reverse ] # => drow
  - [ remove_last_letter ] # => wor
  - [ remove_first_letter ] # => ord
  - [ uppercase_all ] # => WORD
  - [ "append:{0-9}" ] # => word1, word2, word3
  - [ "2 append:{0-9}" ] # => word11, word22, word33
  - [ "replace:o:0", "replace:a:4", "replace:e:3" ] # => w0rd, h3ll0
```

Each mutations file has to have a `name` and a `mutation_sets` value as shown in the example. The above mutation sets will generate, from a single word, 27 other words.

```
administrator
administrator
rotartsinimda
administrato
dministrator
ADMINISTRATOR
administrator0
[.. snip ..]
administrator9
administrator00
[.. snip ..]
administrator99
4dministr4t0r
```

If you'd like to check your mutation file for errors before using it, you can use the following syntax to parse and print the summary.

```
gorilla --mutations-file muts.yml 
```

## scraping web pages for words

(For now) you can only scrap a specific page for words and styles and script tags won't be removed, this wil be implemented in a future release of gorilla. 

You can specify a page using the `--from-website`/`-w` argument. For example

```
gorilla --from-website https://example.org/
```

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/35298550/183974047-68fb86d4-a8a7-4b1e-9e27-0cf512c95988.png)

The above command will print every word from that website. You can add other arguments shown previously like `--mutations-file`/`-f`, `--mutation`/`-m` and of course `--output-file`/`-o` to save them (instead of printing).

## conditional mutations

You can apply a set of mutations to specific words that meet certain conditions/condition. This only makes sense in yaml files. 

The following mutations file will remove words that don't contain the string `admin`. Unlike the previous mutations, this can remove words.

```yaml
name: filtering_words

mutation_sets:
  - [ "if_contains:admin" ]
```

Another example is the following, which will add an underscore only to words that are longer than 5 characters.

```yaml
name: conditional_mutation

mutation_sets:
  - [ "if_length:>5", "append:_" ],
  - [ "! if_length:>5" ]
```

Notice we had to add another mutation set that begins with the negated version of the first if mutation because otherwise the words that are shorter than 6 characters will be removed.

## other mutations

gorilla supports many other mutations and since the tool is in early development it would be very painful to maintain a list of them here. If you are curious about the other mutations, you can check out the `Action` enum from `src/mutation.rs` file.

## using common password/username formats to build wordlists 

Formats are defined in formatting sets via yaml files and are supplied to gorilla via the `--from-formatting`/`-q` argument. Currently there's only one formatting set made, it is located at `sets/formatting/basic_usernames.yml`. And it looks (similar) to this.

```yaml
name: basic_usernames

fields:
  - [ f_name ]
  - [ l_name ]

formatting_sets:
  - [ "{f_name}_{l_name}" ]
  - [ "{l_name}{f_name}" ]
  - [ ["{f_name}", [1st_letter]], "_{l_name}" ]
  - [ ["{f_name}", [1st_letter]], "{l_name}" ]
```

The required fields are `name`, `fields` and `formatting_sets`. The `fields` value is the user's profile and it contains information that is later used in the `formatting_sets`.

If you run the set, you will be prompted for each field and the usernames will be generated.

(of course, you can use the other arguments normally, like `--mutations-file`/`-f` to generate new words via mutations or `--output-file`/`-o` to save the words)

Each formatting set is an array of strings that are later appended. So `["{f_name}", "{l_name}"]` is equivalent to `["{f_name}{l_name}"]`. Instead of a string, you can supply an array, this allows you to apply mutations that you have used before to extend wordlists.

```yaml
- [ "{f_name}_", [ "{l_name}", [ reverse ] ] ]
```

If the `f_name` is `joe` and `l_name` is `doe`, the resulting formatting will generate `joe_eod`. Mutations useful in formatting sets are `remove_last_letter`, `remove_first_letter` and `1st_letter`

If you want to apply a formatting sets to many user profiles, you can use the `--with-csv`/`-c` argument to supply a CSV file. For the `basic_usernames` formatting set, the CSV should be formatted like this:

```csv
f_name,l_name
joe,doe
james,smith
robert,smith
```
